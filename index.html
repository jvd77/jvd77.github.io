            <td><p>My main professional goal is to put my background in electrical and computer engineering to good use in a fulfilling R&amp;D career. 
            As a quick learner with a solid understanding of programming and engineering fundamentals, I believe I am well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to almost any team effort by leveraging past experience and developing new skills as necessary. 
            I have worked on projects ranging from low-level ASIC layouts to high-level machine-learning software, but my recent projects have focused on characterizing the effects of radiation on microelectronics. I am willing and able to attain a DOE security clearance, if necessary, and references are available upon request.</p></td>
